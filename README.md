# Overview



As a software developer, I am continually striving to enhance my skills through practical projects. This Notes App project is designed to improve my understanding of React and state management while providing a useful tool for efficient note management.


**Description of the Software**

The Notes App allows users to easily create, edit, organize, and search notes. It includes text formatting options like bold, italic, underline, and lists. Users can add tags to group notes, search by title, content, or tags, and sort notes by creation date, modification date, or title. A folder system is also included for better organization.

**Purpose for Creating this Software**

The goal of this software is to create a practical tool for efficient note management and to deepen my understanding of React features, including state management, component lifecycle, and conditional rendering. This project aims to enhance my problem-solving skills and improve my ability to design user-friendly interfaces.

# Development Environment

**Tools Used**


Visual Studio Code (VS Code): I used VS Code as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE) due to its powerful features, extensive extensions, and user-friendly interface. It helped streamline coding, debugging, and version control.

Node.js: This was used to manage the backend environment and handle npm (Node Package Manager) for managing project dependencies.

npm: I used npm to install and manage the various packages and libraries required for the project, such as React, React DOM, and CKEditor.

Git: Version control was managed using Git, which allowed me to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of the project.

**Programming Language**


The main programming language for this project was JavaScript. I used it with the React framework, which is a tool that helps build user interfaces, especially for applications that need to update data without reloading the whole page.

Using JavaScript and React, I created a Notes App that lets users easily create, edit, organize, and search their notes with features like text formatting, tagging, searching, and sorting.
